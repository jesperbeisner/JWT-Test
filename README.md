# JWT-Test

Just a small implementation of frontend and backend communicating and securing parts of the backend with JWT.
Just for testing purposes and to see if this is working and the right way of doing such things.

## Setup
Open two terminals in the JWT-Test folder and run:
```
php -S localhost:8080 -t ./backend/public
php -S localhost:8081 -t ./frontend/public
```
Local PHP8 version needed.
